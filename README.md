### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm Horacio, a Spaniard lost in Brittany (France).

I work as VP of DevRel at [Clever Cloud](https://clever-cloud.com/). I am also the co-founder and leader of the [FinistDevs](https://finistdevs.org/) and [@RdvSpeakers](https://twitter.com/RdvSpeakers) communities.

I love web development, and everything around Web Components and standards web in particular. I also love to discuss Kubernetes, AI and cloud in general.

I am a frequent speaker at conferences and meetups, you can find my [speaker profile on Notist](https://noti.st/lostinbrittany).
