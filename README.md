### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm Horacio, a Spaniard lost in Brittany (France).

After some years as [Warp 10](https://www.warp10.io/) frontend leader as Cityzen Data (now [SenX](https://senx.io/)), I work as DevRel (Developer Relations) Leader at [OVHcloud](https://ovhcloud.com). I am also the co-founder and leader of the [FinistDevs](https://finistdevs.org/).
